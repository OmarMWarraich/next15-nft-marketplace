## Key Files

- `contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol`: Main NFT marketplace smart contract.
- `app/create-nft/page.tsx`: NFT creation UI.
- `app/created-nfts/page.tsx`: Creator dashboard for listed NFTs.
- `app/nft-details/page.tsx`: NFT details and purchase/resell.
- `test/Lock.ts`: Example Hardhat test.
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Custom Tailwind theme.
- `hardhat.config.ts`: Hardhat project config.

## Authentication (thirdweb)

This project uses [thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallets/auth) for secure, web3-native authentication and wallet connection.

### Setup

1. Install the thirdweb package:

   ```bash
   npm install thirdweb
   ```

2. Add the following environment variables to `.env.local`:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=localhost
   NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=your-auth-private-key-here
   ```

   - Get your client ID and secret key from [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
   - The private key can be any valid Ethereum private key (no funds required).

3. The app is wrapped in `ThirdwebProvider` (`lib/ThirdwebProvider.tsx`) in `app/layout.tsx`.
4. The wallet connect/auth UI is provided by `ConnectButton` in `components/ThirdwebConnect.tsx`, used in the Navbar.
5. Server actions for authentication are implemented in `actions/login.ts` and wired to the ConnectButton's `auth` prop.

### Usage

- Users can connect their wallet and sign in using the Connect button in the Navbar.
- Authentication/session logic is handled via server actions (`getLoginPayload`, `doLogin`, `isLoggedIn`, `doLogout`).
- You can extend these actions to integrate with your backend/session store as needed.

## Customization

- **Theming**: Edit `tailwind.config.ts` and `ThemeProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Smart Contracts**: Extend `NFTMarketplace.sol` for royalties, auctions, etc.
- **Wallet Integration**: Extend or customize thirdweb authentication in `components/ThirdwebConnect.tsx` and `actions/login.ts`.
